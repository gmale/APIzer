# APIzer
Exploratory tool for browsing APIs.

#### Background
I find myself needing to poke around with API's very frequently. A common use case is testing a new service and verifying issues with colleagues. Since I live on the command line, I frequently write shell scripts to facilitate this process. This allows me to hammer on an API very efficiently while also providing an avenue for sanity checks when I need to confirm 100% that something is misbehaving.

Admittedly, I'm finally tired of ZSH scripts. A modern programming language like Ruby offers so much more power, married with code that's easier to maintain and *test*.

#### Objective
**I am not a Ruby guy.** Currently, I don't even know Ruby. So this repo serves as an exploratory tool to facilitate my daily needs while browsing APIs and also to learn ruby/Thor along the way. Two birds. One stone.
